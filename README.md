Summary: After watching ‘Blue Zone” documentary I was interested to study the relationship between Longevity, and happiness. Using Kaggle, At first I found a ‘Life Expectancy based on Geographic Locations’ that had data from 2000 to 2015. Additionally, I found data on World Happiness report for 2015. 

Data: The main uses of this data was to see if there was a relationship between the top countries for longevity, and happiness. In the Wold Happiness Report there were 6 key figures measured and those were used as the basis of my project. Thankfully the data was not very dirty, so I did not need to do much wrangling mostly organization. First I just used the data for 2015, and organized by the 6 key figures. 

Results: I wanted to answer if there is a relationship between longevity and happiness and metrics are use to define happiness in this world. Also I wanted to look at the countries that are the top 10 and understand what they are doing, or not doing.
